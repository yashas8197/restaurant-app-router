      <p>
        A restaurant’s mission, vision, and values make up part of your brand’s
        identity. They fuel business decisions while inspiring customers to
        frequent and employees to work for your restaurant. Creating a mission
        statement for your restaurant can help you think critically about your
        goals, beyond serving delicious food.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to be the most sustainable restaurant in New York by
        sourcing our ingredients locally, supplementing produce with herbs grown
        on our rooftop garden, and giving back to the community through urban
        farming education.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to give our customers a place to celebrate life’s special
        moments by offering the best food, service, and ambiance in Toronto.
